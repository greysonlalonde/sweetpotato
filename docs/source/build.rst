Build
=======

Packaging an app
----------------

1. `Create an expo account <https://expo.dev/signup>`_ if you don't have one.

2. Run these terminal commands in your project directory:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv) $ eas login
    (venv) $ eas build:configure
    (venv) $ eas build --platform your_platform_here

Distributing the app
----------------
You can distribute your application through a platform specific app store, or as an internal distribution.
Distribution steps will be added in the near future, but for now visit `<https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/>`_
